# Project ModelCrafter 🛠️

## Description 📝

Welcome to my **ModelCrafter** Project! This repository is a personal project dedicated to developing and testing various data science models from scratch. The primary focus of this project is to enhance the understanding of the underlying mathematics and programming principles behind these models. It serves as a learning platform for exploring different techniques in data modeling, analysis, and machine learning.
